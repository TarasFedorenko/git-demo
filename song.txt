Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but not an android)

[Verse 2]
When I am king
You will be first against the wall
With your opinion
Which is of no consequence at all

[Chorus]
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)
What's that?
(I may be paranoid, but no android)Please, could you stop the noise?
I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices
In my head
